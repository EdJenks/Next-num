# Next-num

An app to implement the method nextNum() and a minimal set of unit tests.

The app aims to solve the problem of being given Random Numbers (e.g [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]) and frequencies/probabilities that they should be reproduced in (e.g [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01]). In this exmaple, if we run the app 100 times, we hope to get the following results:
-1: 1 times
0: 22 times
1: 57 times
2: 20 times
3: 0 times
. As the results are random, these results are unlikely, but the proportional frequencies get closer with each run.
